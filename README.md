# Weather Android App
Welcome to the Weather Android App repository! This project is an Android application developed in Java that leverages a free weather API to retrieve and display weather information in response to user-inputted city names. Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights into working with RESTful APIs, particularly extracting data from JSON format to showcase current weather conditions and today's weather forecast.

## Features
City Search: Input the city name to retrieve specific weather details.
Current Weather: Display real-time weather conditions for the selected city.
Weather Forecast: Access today's weather forecast to plan your day effectively.

## Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for Android app development.
Android Studio: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.
RESTful API: Integration with a free weather API to obtain weather data in JSON format.
JSON Parsing: Extracting relevant information from the JSON response for presentation.
